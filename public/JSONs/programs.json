      "name": "Aerodynamics Workshop",
      "description": "In the Aerodynamics Workshop, students learn how airflow impacts speed and efficiency by designing and testing their own aerodynamic models in a mini wind tunnel. They experiment with different shapes, gaining insights into how engineers use aerodynamics to create faster, more efficient vehicles.",

      "name": "Rider Development Workshop",
      "description": "The Rider Development Workshop introduces students to the science behind human-powered racing, teaching them how to maximise energy output and optimise race strategies through gear changes and racing line techniques. Especially ideal for schools with trikes, this workshop has a wide range of available options depending on the knowledge, year level and time length available to the students.",
